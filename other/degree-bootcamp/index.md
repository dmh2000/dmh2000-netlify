### CS Degree vs Bootcamp : What do you really need to know?"

#### Getting Hired

Its a common question on Reddit, YouTube, Blind etc. Is a CS degree
better for getting hired than completing a bootcamp. A CS degree will
get you past the initial screening better than a bootcamp cert.
Of course there are counterexamples, but if you look at the required
qualifications of software jobs on Indeed or wherever, there is almost
always a requirement for BS or equivalent experience.
Having a BSCS is a checkbox. 'Equivalent experience' means the applicant would have to make the case
that a bootcamp completion meets that bar.

I'm going to leave this here: the BS is preferred. period. That's
not the point of this article. What I want to explore is What
you really need to know and how do you get it, from whatever source.

This is all my opinion of course.

#### BS Computer Science

I would contend that in a conventional 4 year university,
one could get the core of what you need to go forward as a developer
in 2 years. Liberal Arts folks might argue that history,
language and social studies make you a well rounded person. Maybe so,
but looking back on my coursework I can't say that any of that
did anything for my ability to develop software. I could have learned
and retained the equivalent by reading 3 or 4 books.

Now I'm talking here about conventional semesters, 2 a year. So it
isn't easy to compress it like a bootcamp would. Here's a proposed
minimal curriculum for a compressed 3 semester schedule. I'm going to
use the courses from Stanford as examples.

- Computer Science
  - Required
    - CS 106 Programming Absractions (intro to programming)
    - CS 103 Math Foundations of Computer Science
    - CS 109 Probability for Computer Science
      - must have if you want to do any kind of ML/AI
    - CS 161 Data Structures and Algorithms
  - Electives
    - the value of most of the other CS classes I took in college was the practice I got writing programs. here are some examples.
    - graphics
    - AI
    - numerical analysis
    - operating systems
    - compilers
    - survey of languages
    - intro to hardware
    - data science
    - networks
- Science
  - Physics 21 : Mechanics
- Math

  - Math 19 : Calculus 1
    - you need to know what a derivative and an integral are
  - Math 51 : Linear Algebra
    - if you want to do any kind of ML/AI or graphics.

  Schedule

  I think these are in the right order of progression at Stanford. If
  not then move the CS around.

  - Semester 1
    - CS 106 Programming Abstractions (C++)
      - Intro to programming equivalent
    - Physics 21 Mechanics
      - first semester physics
    - Math 19 Calculus 1
      - first semester calculus
  - Semester 2
    - CS 103 Math Foundations of CS
      - basic thory of computation
    - CS 161 Data Structures and Algorithms
      - most important!
    - Math 51 : Linear Algebra
    - CS Elective
  - Semester 3
    - CS 109 Probability for CS
    - 3 CS Electives
      - specialization and practice

That's three hard semesters at a top college. In a four year
program you would space them out more to have a more progressive
schedule.

Its obvious that there are no classes for Javascript and React,
front end or back end frameworks, etc. Not much practical application.
But with this background you would be able to quickly pick up any language and/or framework you need.
