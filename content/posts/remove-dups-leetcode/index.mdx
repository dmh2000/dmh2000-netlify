### A couple of solutions for LeetCode 'Remove Duplicates from Sorted List I and II'

<br/>

#### Remove Duplicates from Sorted List I 

Problem : "Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once."

This one is relatively easy if you understand single linked lists. The LeetCode problem page gives
you solutions. I'll show mine here but its nothing special. Just keep a previous pointer and 
a current pointer and skip over any node where value of previous == value of current

````go
func deleteDuplicates(head *ListNode) *ListNode {
	var prev *ListNode
	var node *ListNode
	prev = head
	node = prev.Next
	for node != nil {
		if node.Val == prev.Val {
			// delete node
			prev.Next = node.Next
		} else {
			prev = node
		}
		node = node.Next
	}
	return head
}

#### Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II 

Problem : "Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list."
This one is rated 'medium'.

There are plenty of solutions on the web for this one as well, however most of them are 'golfing', which 
if you don't already know means solving in the minimum lines of code. That's a legit approach especially
for interviews. For production code I prefer solutions
that are easier to understand, possibly at the expense of additional O(?) complexity  As long as the complexity 
is acceptable and it isn't (ON^2) or worse. Before you downvote me for that, keep in mind that there are 
algorithms for Mininum Spanning Tree that are better than Prim's or Kruskal's, with [O(inverse-Ackermann) time.

In the usual solutions for this problem, there are some tricky compound logical expressions 
and sort-of complicated link dereferencing. In their favor, they are O(N) time and O(1) space (besides the linked list itself).
My solution is O(N) time but O(N) space. But I contend its a lot easier to understand.

In my solution, rather than trying to figure out the complicated linking and if'ing, I do this:
Go through the list once and just record the duplicates in a set. Then on a second pass
check each node to see if its in the set, and if so, skip over it. Otherwise just move to next node. This
also has the advantage that it doesn't require sorted input. 

In the LeetCode environment this ran just as fast as the conventional solutions, at  least to resolution
of the LeetCode timing. I find that when using Go, and a fast solution, you can get 0ms or 4ms depending
on when you submit. 

If I produced this in an interview I and got pushback I would argue 'its easier to understand'. That might
not fly unless I was able to show the O(1) space version as well. But at least I would have made my point
on the way out the door.

````go

// O(N) time, O(N) memory
func deleteDuplicates2(head *ListNode) *ListNode {
	var m map[int]bool
	var node *ListNode
	var prev *ListNode

	if head == nil {
		return nil
	}

	// ============================================
	// pass one find duplicates and map them
	// ============================================
	m = make(map[int]bool)
	prev = head
	node = prev.Next
	for node != nil {
		if node.Val == prev.Val {
			// record the duplicate
			m[node.Val] = true
		}
		prev = node
		node = node.Next
	}

	// ============================================
	// pass 2 remove nodes where Val is in the map
	// ============================================
	// dup in head is a special case, skip over dups
	for head != nil {
		_, inmap := m[head.Val]
		if inmap {
			head = head.Next
		} else {
			break
		}
	}

	// might be empty
	if head == nil {
		return nil
	}

	// head is not a dup, so continue
	prev = head
	node = prev.Next
	for node != nil {
		_, inmap := m[node.Val]
		if inmap {
			// skip over this node
			node = node.Next
			prev.Next = node
		} else {
			// just advance to next node
			prev = node
			node = node.Next
		}
	}
	return head
}

Here's my Go test fixture if anyone cares (I doubt it). 
I have some utilities for working with LeetCode lists.

````go
func TestRemSort2(T *testing.T) {
	var list *singleLinkedList
	var head *ListNode

	// I have a utility that builds a list from an array spec
	// for use with LeetCode lists
	list = buildList([]int{1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5})
	head = list.head
	head = deleteDuplicates2(head)
	fmt.Print("should be [1] : ")
	printList(head)
	// i checked by printing and check

	list = buildList([]int{1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5})
	head = list.head
	head = deleteDuplicates2(head)
	fmt.Print("should be [1,2,5] :")
	printList(head)

	list = buildList([]int{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5})
	head = list.head
	head = deleteDuplicates2(head)
	fmt.Print("should be [2,5] : ")
	printList(head)

	list = buildList([]int{})
	head = list.head
	head = deleteDuplicates2(head)
	fmt.Print("should be nil : ")
	printList(head)

	list = buildList([]int{1})
	head = list.head
	head = deleteDuplicates2(head)
	fmt.Print("should be [1] : ")
	printList(head)

	list = buildList([]int{1, 1})
	head = list.head
	head = deleteDuplicates2(head)
	fmt.Print("should be nil : ")
	printList(head)
}
